  %p 
    Like most useful products, name.pn was born out of necessity. Developer <b>Quinn</b> #{link_to 'name.pn/quinn-daley', 'https://name.pn/quinn-daley'} is trans &amp; non-binary and uses <i>they/them</i> pronouns and needed a nice way to share how to use those pronouns with business contacts.
  %p
    These days we do a lot of our communicating electronically. We can see a person's name a dozen times and
  %ul 
    %li never learn how to <b>pronounce</b> it the way they want it to be pronounced,
    %li not know what <b>pronouns</b> to use when talking about them in the third person,
    %li want to <b>address them formally</b> but not know what title to use (or even if they want to be addressed by a title),
    %li hear them being called by a shortened version of their name and not know <b>if they actually like it</b>.
  %p name.pn was created to give each person <b>a short URL</b> that you can put in your email signature and your social profiles that gives people all the information they need to address you correctly, including a chance to hear you pronouncing your name in your own voice.
  %p It's free and always will be (although we might add some cool additional paid features in the future for businesses). It's still early in development but it works and it's ready to use now.
