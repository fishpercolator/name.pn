    %li We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data.

  %p To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means.
  %p In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see #{link_to 'your legal rights', '#rights'} below for further information.
