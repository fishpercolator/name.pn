    This privacy policy is provided in a layered format so you can click through to the specific areas set out below.

    name.pn puts you in control - your name, your rules. The short-URL we create and identity data is set and managed by you, and you choose what is made public by using our service.

    name.pn will not ask you for personal information about yourself except where it will be published on your own name.pn page. Apart from a few fields needed to ensure a uniform experience, most data requested is optional and you only need to provide it if you want it to be on your page.

    ### Third-party links
    
    This website may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy statements. When you leave our website, we encourage you to read the privacy policy of every website you visit.

    ## 2. The data we collect about you
    
    Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified - like your name or photo. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).

    We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped together as follows:

    * Identity Data includes various forms of your personal name, your photo/likeness and your social media profiles.
    * Contact Data includes email address.
    * Technical Data includes internet protocol (IP) address, your login data, browser type and version, and the times of your visits.
    * Usage Data includes information about how you use our website.
    * Marketing and Communications Data includes your preferences in receiving marketing from us and your communication preferences.
    
    We also collect, use and share Aggregated Data such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data could be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data will not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature.

    However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy policy.

    We do not collect any Special Categories of Personal Data about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health, and genetic and biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.

    ## 3. How is your personal data collected?
    
    We use different methods to collect data from and about you including:

    * Personal interactions. You may give us your Identity, Contact and Financial Data by filling in forms or by sending us an email. This includes personal data you provide when you:
        * create an account on our website;
        * fill out your public profile information using our website;
        * subscribe to our service or publications;
        * request marketing to be sent to you;
        * give us feedback or contact us.
    * Automated technologies or interactions. As you interact with our website, we will automatically collect Technical Data about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns. We collect this personal data by using cookies, server logs and other similar technologies. Technical Data from the following parties:
        * analytics providers such as Google based outside the UK;
        * advertising networks such as Instagram based outside the UK; and
        * search information providers such as Google based outside the UK.
    
    ## 4. How we use your personal data
    
    We will only use your personal data as the law allows us to. We make sure we have a clear legal basis. We will use your personal data in the following circumstances:

    * Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. We have a legitimate interest in offering this service to allow people to better communicate their name and personal pronouns on the internet.
    * Where we need to comply with a legal obligation.
    
    We do not use consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data, but we will get your consent before sending third party direct marketing communications to you via email or text message.

    You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by contacting us or by using [the opt-out form available on your account page](#{edit_user_registration_path}).

    ### Purposes for which we will use your personal data
    
    We have set out a table of all the ways we plan to use your personal data, and which of the legal bases we rely on to do so. We have also identified what our legitimate interests are where appropriate.

    We may process your personal data for more than one lawful ground depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your data.

    ### Cookies
    
    You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become inaccessible or not function properly.

    The cookies we use are:

    ### Change of purpose
    
    We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.

    If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.

    If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.

    Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.

    ## 5. Disclosures of your personal data
    
    We may share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table above.

    Internal Third Parties as set out in the Glossary.
    External Third Parties as set out in the Glossary.
    Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy.
    We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

    ## 6. International transfers
    
    Many of our external third parties are based outside the UK so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the UK

    Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the UK, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

    We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data.
    Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved for use in the UK which give personal data the same protection it has in the UK.
    Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the UK.

    ## 7. Data security
    
    We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered by people other than you or disclosed.

    In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. The duty of confidentiality does not extend to information you have made public, but does apply to private information you provide to us such as your email address and IP address.

    We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

    ## 8. Data retention
    
    How long will you use my personal data for?
    We will only keep your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for. You can choose to keep using name.pn as long as you like, and while using it your personal data will be retained. If you want to stop using name.pn, your data will be deleted from the main application immediately and from backups in 4 weeks.

    We may keep your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.

    To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means.

    In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see your legal rights below for further information.

    In some circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

    ## 9. Your legal rights

    What we may need from you
    We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

    Time limit to respond
    We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
