        - To address you properly in English, people don't need to know your gender, but they do need to know your personal pronouns.
        - This is especially important for people who are trans and gender-nonconforming, and for people with unusual or gender-neutral names. We ask everyone to provide this information so as not to make some users feel like the odd one out.
        - Most people will need to select only one item below. Please choose the pronouns that feel most natural for talking about you.
        - The option to select multiple pronouns is available for people who use multiple pronouns. If you select multiple pronouns, you can also drag-and-drop them into the order you'd like them to be displayed on your profile.
