## Roadmap

[Our roadmap for the next milestone and beyond can be viewed
here](https://github.com/orgs/fishpercolator/projects/1).

All cards on the
roadmap have their own space for conversation, which you are welcome to join in
with. Those we particularly want input on are marked
"[question](https://github.com/fishpercolator/name.pn/projects/1?card_filter_query=label%3Aquestion)". Please take a look at these to see if
you can help!

If you are a fan of a specific item on the roadmap, drop a :+1: emoji on it
using the "smiley face" button so we can prioritise the most important issues.

## Raise issues or feature requests

Bugs and feature requests are extremely welcome! Head on over to our
[issues page](https://github.com/fishpercolator/name.pn/issues) to create a new
issue for discussion.

Please take a look to see if there is already a thread discussing your bug or
feature before adding it!

## Contribute code

If you'd like to get involved with making code changes yourself, that would be
awesome! Feel free to start a discussion about your idea in the issues section
before you begin, or not!

There are guides to getting a development environment set up and how to do
things like run the tests over in the [README](README.md) file.

To contribute a change please follow this process:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create your change on a branch - we prefer branches named (e.g.) 
`bug/description_of_bug` or `feature/feature_name`
3. Make sure that new tests are added to defend it. If it's a new feature, those
tests should be in Gherkin/Spinach and live in the `features/` folder.
4. Make sure all the existing tests pass.
5. Raise a [pull request](https://github.com/fishpercolator/name.pn/pulls) to
discuss the feature and, if necessary, go through a code review before it is
accepted.

## Any questions

Any questions, feel free to get in touch with the primary maintainer
